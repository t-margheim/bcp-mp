    <h2>Confession of Sin</h2>

    <p>
        Let us confess our sins against God and our neighbor.
    </p>

    <p>
        Most merciful God,<br>
        we confess that we have sinned against you<br>
        in thought, word, and deed,<br>
        by what we have done,<br>
        and by what we have left undone.<br>
        We have not loved you with our whole heart;<br>
        we have not loved our neighbors as ourselves.<br>
        We are truly sorry and we humbly repent.<br>
        For the sake of your Son Jesus Christ,<br>
        have mercy on us and forgive us;<br>
        that we may delight in your will,<br>
        and walk in your ways,<br>
        to the glory of your Name. Amen.<br>
    </p>

    <p>
        Almighty God have mercy on you, forgive you all your sins<br>
        through our Lord Jesus Christ, strengthen you in all<br>
        goodness, and by the power of the Holy Spirit keep you in<br>
        eternal life. Amen.<br>
    </p>

    <h2>The Apostles' Creed</h2>

    <p>
        <p>I believe in God, the Father almighty, <br />
            &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;creator of heaven and earth; <br />
            I believe in Jesus Christ, his only Son, our Lord. <br />
            &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;He was conceived by the power of the Holy Spirit <br />
            &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;and born of the Virgin Mary. <br />
            &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;He suffered under Pontius Pilate, <br />
            &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;was crucified, died, and was buried. <br />
            &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;He descended to the dead. <br />
            &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;On the third day he rose again. <br />
            &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;He ascended into heaven, <br />
            &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;and is seated at the right hand of the Father. <br />
            &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;He will come again to judge the living and the dead. <br />
            I believe in the Holy Spirit, <br />
            &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;the holy catholic Church, <br />
            &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;the communion of saints, <br />
            &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;the forgiveness of sins<br />
            &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;the resurrection of the body, <br />
            &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;and the life everlasting. Amen. </p>

    </p>

    <h2>The Prayers</h2>

    <p>
        Our Father in heaven, <br />
        &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;hallowed be your Name, <br />
        &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;your kingdom come, <br />
        &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;your will be done, <br />
        &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;on earth as in
        heaven. <br />
        Give us today our daily bread. <br />
        Forgive us our sins <br />
        &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;as we forgive those <br />
        &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;who sin against us.
        <br />
        Save us from the time of trial, <br />
        &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;and deliver us from evil. <br />
        For the kingdom, the power, <br />
        &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;and the glory are yours, <br />
        &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;now and for ever. Amen.

    <h3>The General Thanksgiving</h3>

    <p>
        Almighty God, Father of all mercies, <br />
        we your unworthy servants give you humble thanks <br />
        for all your goodness and loving-kindness <br />
        to us and to all whom you have made. <br />
        We bless you for our creation, preservation, <br />
        and all the blessings of this life; <br />
        but above all for your immeasurable love <br />
        in the redemption of the world by our Lord Jesus Christ; <br />
        for the means of grace, and for the hope of glory. <br />
        And, we pray, give us such an awareness of your mercies, <br />
        that with truly thankful hearts we may show forth your praise, <br />
        not only with our lips, but in our lives, <br />
        by giving up our selves to your service, <br />
        and by walking before you <br />
        in holiness and righteousness all our days; <br />
        through Jesus Christ our Lord, <br />
        to whom, with you and the Holy Spirit, <br />
        be honor and glory throughout all ages. <em>Amen.</em>
    </p>

    <h3>A Prayer of St Chrysostom</h3>

    <p>
        Almighty God, you have given us grace at this time with one
        accord to make our common supplication to you; and you
        have promised through your well-beloved Son that when two
        or three are gathered together in his Name you will be in the
        midst of them: Fulfill now, O Lord, our desires and petitions
        as may be best for us; granting us in this world knowledge of
        your truth, and in the age to come life everlasting. <em>Amen.</em>
    </p>
