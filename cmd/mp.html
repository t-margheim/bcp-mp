<h2>Confession of Sin</h2>

<p>
    Let us confess our sins against God and our neighbor.
</p>

<p>
    Most merciful God,<br>
    we confess that we have sinned against you<br>
    in thought, word, and deed,<br>
    by what we have done,<br>
    and by what we have left undone.<br>
    We have not loved you with our whole heart;<br>
    we have not loved our neighbors as ourselves.<br>
    We are truly sorry and we humbly repent.<br>
    For the sake of your Son Jesus Christ,<br>
    have mercy on us and forgive us;<br>
    that we may delight in your will,<br>
    and walk in your ways,<br>
    to the glory of your Name. Amen.<br>
</p>

<p>
    Almighty God have mercy on you, forgive you all your sins<br>
    through our Lord Jesus Christ, strengthen you in all<br>
    goodness, and by the power of the Holy Spirit keep you in<br>
    eternal life. Amen.<br>
</p>

<h2>The Apostles' Creed</h2>

<p>
    <p>I believe in God, the Father almighty, <br />
        &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;creator of heaven and earth; <br />
        I believe in Jesus Christ, his only Son, our Lord. <br />
        &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;He was conceived by the power of the Holy Spirit <br />
        &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;and born of the Virgin Mary. <br />
        &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;He suffered under Pontius Pilate, <br />
        &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;was crucified, died, and was buried. <br />
        &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;He descended to the dead. <br />
        &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;On the third day he rose again. <br />
        &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;He ascended into heaven, <br />
        &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;and is seated at the right hand of the Father. <br />
        &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;He will come again to judge the living and the dead. <br />
        I believe in the Holy Spirit, <br />
        &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;the holy catholic Church, <br />
        &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;the communion of saints, <br />
        &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;the forgiveness of sins<br />
        &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;the resurrection of the body, <br />
        &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;and the life everlasting. Amen. </p>

</p>

<h2>The Prayers</h2>

<p>
    Our Father in heaven, <br />
    &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;hallowed be your Name, <br />
    &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;your kingdom come, <br />
    &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;your will be done, <br />
    &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;on earth as in
    heaven. <br />
    Give us today our daily bread. <br />
    Forgive us our sins <br />
    &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;as we forgive those <br />
    &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;who sin against us.
    <br />
    Save us from the time of trial, <br />
    &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;and deliver us from evil. <br />
    For the kingdom, the power, <br />
    &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;and the glory are yours, <br />
    &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;now and for ever. Amen.
