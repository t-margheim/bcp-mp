<h2>Confession of Sin</h2>

<p>
    Let us confess our sins against God and our neighbor.
</p>

<p>
    Most merciful God,<br>
    we confess that we have sinned against you<br>
    in thought, word, and deed,<br>
    by what we have done,<br>
    and by what we have left undone.<br>
    We have not loved you with our whole heart;<br>
    we have not loved our neighbors as ourselves.<br>
    We are truly sorry and we humbly repent.<br>
    For the sake of your Son Jesus Christ,<br>
    have mercy on us and forgive us;<br>
    that we may delight in your will,<br>
    and walk in your ways,<br>
    to the glory of your Name. Amen.<br>
</p>

<p>
    Almighty God have mercy on you, forgive you all your sins<br>
    through our Lord Jesus Christ, strengthen you in all<br>
    goodness, and by the power of the Holy Spirit keep you in<br>
    eternal life. Amen.<br>
</p>

<h2>The Apostles' Creed</h2>

<p>
    I believe in God, the Father almighty,<br>
    creator of heaven and earth;<br>
    <br>
    I believe in Jesus Christ, his only Son, our Lord.<br>
    He was conceived by the power of the Holy Spirit<br>
    and born of the Virgin Mary.<br>
    He suffered under Pontius Pilate,<br>
    was crucified, died, and was buried.<br>
    He descended to the dead.<br>
    On the third day he rose again.<br>
    He ascended into heaven,<br>
    and is seated at the right hand of the Father.<br>
    He will come again to judge the living and the dead.<br>
    <br>
    I believe in the Holy Spirit,<br>
    the holy catholic Church,<br>
    the communion of saints,<br>
    the forgiveness of sins<br>
    the resurrection of the body,<br>
    and the life everlasting. Amen.<br>
</p>

<h2>The Prayers</h2>

<p>
    Our Father in heaven,
    hallowed be your Name,
    your kingdom come,
    your will be done,
    on earth as in heaven.
    Give us today our daily bread.
    Forgive us our sins
    as we forgive those who sin against us.
    Save us from the time of trial,
    and deliver us from evil.
    For the kingdom, the power,
    and the glory are yours,
    now and for ever. Amen.
